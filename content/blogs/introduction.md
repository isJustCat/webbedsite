Hello world!

This little post is my attempt of an introduction. Expect it to be rephrased and updated at some point soon.

My Name is Ally.  
I am a non-binary trans* person born in 2005.  
I am the encompassing legal entity to a plural system that in its entirety is not a human/person - feel free to ask about it.

I have a background in climate activism and NGO work,  
and have been involved in various protests, where i also have been providing technical infrastructure
(For example, i have been setting up radio links to provide internet connectivity to remote locations, giving workshops on various topics, provisioning servers and client devices for collectives, maintaining software... and lots of other cool things)  
I have contributed to Open Source Projects in the past.  

My main interests lie in technology (Electronics, Software development and infrastructure operation), art (mostly music, lyrics and photography) and communication.

From very young age, i have been tinkering with electronics, taking things apart and (most of the times even successfully!) trying to puzzle them back together, summoning segfaults and asking curious questions which still are qualities that according to other people's feedback make me a good engineer today. 

While i  have been confronted with a lot of challenges since my early childhood, coming out of an abusive household where i ran away when i was turning 15,  
and have a bunch of special needs due to chronic illness and being autistic (which is the reason i only work in part-time, to ensure that i get enough rest)  
i am striving to heal, and like to provide other entities perspective.

I reject the notion of "professionalism", as it often enforces conformity that makes me act against my ideals and hide my true self.  
I have tried that in the past, and severly burnt out, so now i am practicing radical honesty.

I will, independent of context, be accountable for my actions and own up to my mistakes.  
I will always act to the best of my ability.  
If that is not enough for you, i am not interested in working with or for you.  
If you don't want me to be honest and open and share my thoughts, there is no point in talking to me.

To be continued :)
